# 1st-Protfolio

This is the first portfolio I created when I was in my 2nd semester.
I had forgotten to upload it to GitHub, but I recently found it on my old pendrive.
I’m posting it on GitHub now

I had a great experience building this project. It helped me strengthen my fundamentals in HTML and CSS, including semantic tags, paired and unpaired tags in HTML, shorthand and longhand CSS properties, and basic animation techniques
